# Music_Genre_Classification_Based_On_Lyrics

Unstructured data such as document and text is an important form of data widely available on the internet. Lyrics often contain political, social, and economic themes—as well as aesthetic elements—and so can communicate culturally significant messages, which makes it an ideal source for doing natural language studying. 

This project is interested in predicting music genres, specifically pop and christian music, based on the song’s lyrics and extracting important words that can discriminate these two genres well.
